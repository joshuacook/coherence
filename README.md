# A Metric For Assessing The Quality of Low-Rank Models

A generalized approach to computing the Coherence of a low-rank model provides an objective measurement of its quality.

## Background
A low-rank model (LRM, e.g. PCA) is frequently used as part of the greater pipeline in preparing a cluster model.

An unsupervised learning task, a LRM can not be assessed against a label vector, but must be measured against some intrinsic quality of the data.

## Coherence
Semantic Coherence is a metric specific to the domain of topic modeling. We propose a metric Coherence, more general than Semantic Coherence, and capable of being applied to a more general category of LRMs.

## The Metric: Coherence
1. Low-rank models typically generate a loadings matrix, L, as a by-product of the model fitting process.
1. The values of a loading matrix column represents the expression of each original feature vector in the corresponding low-rank model column.
1. These values can be used to compute a scaled mutual information for each pair of vectors.
1. A sum taken over all pairs is an intrinsic measurement of the mutual information in the given column vector. We call this sum coherence.

## Results
Preliminary results on this small data set show that cluster models using LRM vectors selected using coherence to be more performant than models generated by maximizing explained variance.
